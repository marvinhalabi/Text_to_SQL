# Text to SQL üóÉÔ∏è

`Text to SQL` is a Streamlit app that converts natural language queries into SQL queries using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The app provides an interactive interface for users to input their questions, and it returns both the SQL code and an explanation of the query. Additionally, users can input database schema information for more accurate SQL generation.

## Features üöÄ

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert plain text queries into SQL.
- **Schema Support**: Optionally input your database schema for more precise SQL generation.
- **Random Example Queries**: Get random example queries to test the functionality.
- **SQL Server Toggle**: Connect to a SQL server to execute queries directly.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Input Your Query**: Enter a question in plain language, like "Show all employees from the 'employees' table."
- **Optional Schema**: Paste your database schema for more accurate SQL generation.
- **SQL Generation**: The app generates an SQL query using OpenAI's GPT-4 model and returns the result in SQL format.

## Example Queries üìÑ

Here are some example queries that you can try:
- "Show all employees from the 'employees' table."
- "Find the total sales for each month."
- "List all products with a price greater than $50."
- "Get the number of orders placed in the last 30 days."
- "Retrieve the top 5 customers by total spend."
